Hawaiʻi Digital Equity Dashboard

My solution for a equity dashboard for Hawaiʻi, offers a real-time, comprehensive view of digital access and equity across the state. It visualizes data on broadband availability, device costs, digital literacy levels, and socioeconomic demographics, allowing users to explore both statewide and regional disparities. With impact maps highlighting areas of low internet access, high device costs, and vulnerable populations!

Requirements

	•	Interactive Maps: Visualize broadband connectivity, demographic data, and device affordability across Hawaiʻi.
	•	Dynamic Visualizations: Use embedded charts to explore key metrics like income distribution and educational attainment.
	•	Community Feedback Integration: Collect and display feedback from residents through Survey123.
	•	Customizable Views: Toggle between layers for a tailored exploration of digital equity data.
	•	Data: Incorporates data from Census.gov and other sources.

Technologies Used

	•	ArcGIS Experience Builder: Framework for building the interactive dashboard.
	•	Survey123: Tool for collecting and visualizing community feedback.
	•	Chart.js: Library for creating dynamic data visualizations.
	•	Census.gov: Source of demographic and socioeconomic data.
	•	Netlify: Hosting for the public-facing dashboard.
